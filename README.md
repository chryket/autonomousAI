1. enter the following at a terminal. 

```git clone https://github.com/chryket/autonomousAI.git
```

you should get something that looks like this....

```Cloning into 'autonomousAI'...
remote: Enumerating objects: 14, done.
remote: Counting objects: 100% (14/14), done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (14/14), done.
remote: Total 14 (delta 4), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0
Receiving objects: 100% (14/14), 5.99 KiB | 5.99 MiB/s, done.
Resolving deltas: 100% (4/4), done.
```

2. change directory into the newly created folder

```cd autonomousAI

```

3. Now create a sandbox where you can play without breaking anything. it'll make a copy or "branch" of where things are at the moment. 

```git checkout branch yourweirdnamehere

```

i created a branch called staging. I made a few changes to some files, added a file, then thought it would be nice to get some feedback, so I "push" my local changes to the "remote" so we can all discuss. 

4. type git status to check first.
