## who am i?

Just another free spirit. 

Contemplating on big things like hedge fund trillions,geological time or the mind of God is dangerous: it's too big for mortal minds to comprehend without descending into madness. "Do not look into the sea", say the Swahili, echoing a thought that goes all the way from [The Reforms of UruKAgina](https://www.oldest.org/artliterature/writing/) , through Lao Tzu, Buddha, Jesus , lots of half forgotten arabs, greeks and russians, through to modern thinkers like Einstein, Penrose, Sheldrake, to name but a few.

To these illustrious names I would now add all the caring, compassionate, sane people who have had similar thoughts when confronted by the insanity of the response by the medical establishment to what is now commonly referred to as COVID-19.  This site is for all of you.
