__Saturday September 11__

Not much fact checking today, as I was doing a little boots on ground work. Its very hard to find the right tone. I approached my local pick and pay manager to ask questions about occupational health and safety. Somehow things went badly wrong and I had to leave. The manager ended up chasing me outside and taking a picture of my license plate. I went back with my ID to give him my details but he had security throw me out again. All very strange. i gave requested a response from Pick and Pay. Lets see what they say!

The messaging continues with ???? from ??? telling us we need to get vaccinated otr the reinsurers will pull out. 

Good news from momentum and a few other responsible financial institutions. Some really good articles from panda .

__Context:__

<small> 
Government, business, and media have been ramping up the coercive and manipulative messaging. 
An assortment of government communications agencies and paid media influencers is assisting them. 
Have a look at this page **[here](/rooigevaar)** to get an idea of just how bad it is.</small>

 Phaahla: Law enforcement needs to focus on vaccine fake news spreaders<br>

### Response

Our Esteemed Health Minister seems to have completely misinterpreted the repeated requests for better information regarding the covid narrative, and now he is thinking of charging those who are trying to help and heal in the complete absence of a functioning public health system. 

	‚ÄúIn the regulations, there is clearly provision, which says circulating fake news is actually a criminal offence.‚Äù

The call for prosecution rings a little hollow when the government faces no accountability for the endlessly extended and illegal state of disaster regulations, which I think he is referring to here. Joe, Those are illegal regulations. Maybe it is high time that law enforcement agencies looked into corrupt government officials. 

There have been terrible consequences because of some of the decisions that the health department, along with the _covid command council_ , and ably assisted by the SAMRC, GAVI and the likes of Francois Venter and others, have pushed on the people of South Africa. 

Just listen to what Busisiwe Mavuso from Business Leadership South Africa has to say.

	If we thought we had a jobs crisis on our hands before this pandemic, 
	we now we have something much, much larger than we had ever imagined. 

Sadly Busi is also banging the drums for Covid-19 vaccine incentives,digital passes and so on. 

	‚ÄúThose who refuse to be vaccinated may well proclaim that is their right,
	 but it is also the right of the rest of us to protect ourselves from the
	 risks posed by unvaccinated people and to do whatever we can to reach the overall vaccination rates necessary for life to go back to normal,‚Äù she said.

Busi also writes elsewhere that she has "focused much of my attention on the plight of women over the past 18 months".  

What is an unvaccinated person, Busi? If someone had a measles vaccination when they were small does that count.
