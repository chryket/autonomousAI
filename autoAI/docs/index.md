# The Red List

We believe that all people should be treated with dignity and respect, and that all people should be treated equally under the Law. 


It is our belief that it is highly unethical to promote poorly tested vaccines. You can read some existing opinions here. 

We feel it is important to give these organisations a chance to explain why they are engaging in this unethical behaviour.

### Footnotes

What is mandatory?

Directly from the Black's Law 'legalese' dictionary. Illegitimate "authority" and man's "law" entrapment language 101:

The Law Dictionary
What is MANDATORY? definition of MANDATORY (Black's Law Dictionary)
Definition of MANDATORY: 305, 47 N. E. 623; Atlanta v. Wright, 119 Ga. 207, 45 S. E. 004; State v. Lewis, 76 Mo. 370; Ex parte Crane, 5 Pet. 190, 8 L. Ed. 92; Marbury v. Madison,
-----------
Mandatory
"The action of mandamus [Latin for mandatory, "We command"] is one, brought in a court of competent jurisdiction, to obtain an older of such court commanding an inferior tribunal, board, corporation, or person to do or not to do an act the performance or omission of which the law enjoins as a duty resulting from an office, trust, or station. Where discretion is left to the inferior tribunal or person, the mandamus can only compel it to act, but cannot control such discretion."
----------
Did you read that correctly? By legalese definition, YOU are INFERIOR to the arbitrary "laws" of the state. I thought the government and it's agencies worked for us? I thought they're supposed to protect our sovereignty?

A mandate is a LEGAL act to compel, NOT LAWFUL and "CANNOT control such discretion"...
Discretion: "Individual choice or judgement"

Translation... 
The state and their agencies can try to compel you to do something, but unless you give them consent, they CANNOT take further action, by their own definition.

Just because someone in "authority" tries to command you, you have a choice. A mandate isn't a law and doesn't require your participation. Wearing a mask or getting injected is a choice... 

IT IS NOT LAW OR LAWFUL

Legal and lawful are NOT the same...

You are complying with arbitrary legal acts that have no power or lawful standing
Any police officer handing out fines, demanding to see your exemption, escorting you off the premises, holding you under duress or ANY other compelling act/command are all UNLAWFUL acts/commands and have NO real power

 • You do NOT need to show exemption 
 • You do NOT need to pay unlawful fines
 • You do NOT need to cooperate 

Policing is supposed to be done via consent, so they can't do a damn thing without it... They only get away with what they do because you're ill informed and don't know how to deal with them...
It is YOUR duty as a sovereign citizen to not comply with unlawful acts of an unlawful government and unlawful police. It's YOUR duty to stop complying with tyrants that have ZERO clue about the "laws" they are enforcing.
 • Language matters
 • Consent matters
 • Constitutional and Common Laws matter
 • Natural Law is the source of your rights and common law is the enactment and protection of your natural rights
 • Rights matter
 • Freedom matters
 • Cherish it and fight for it...
 • When are you going to start being brave and stop complying with tyranny...?
