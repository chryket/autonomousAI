## Context

There is a converted push by special interests to rush a vaccine to market for a poorly understood disease. There are numerous safety concerns.

**üî¥NO testing on children. This must be halted immediately. üî¥** 

For those who tell you that the Covid-19 injection is authorised, approved or licensed remind them of these facts, especially if they are considering that the C19 injection is a good idea for children:

The injections are still in Stage 3 Clinical Trials that do not finish until early 2023:

Currently given emergency approval (EUA), Conditional Marketing Authorisation (CMA) etc all these terms mean they are only being used because of an ‚Äúemergency‚Äù situation. These injections have not been fully licensed anywhere in the world. 

AstraZeneca  Trials: AZ Trials
Pfizer Trials :Pfizer Trials 
AZ example short term approval terms: AZ Approval Terms
Pfizer example short term approval terms : Pfizer Approval Terms

The public should only begin to use drugs or vaccines that are in Stage 4 clinical trials

Pfizer tells us this : Stage 3 not normal

The animals trials for coronavirus vaccines have always failed because the animals got sick and/or died :

The initial trials were short and flawed:

What is the latest scientific evidence saying on the efficacy/ effectiveness of these Vaccines:

Absolute Risk Reduction i.e. the true impact that the injection itself was shown to have at reducing your chances of getting sick with Covid-19 was just 0.84% for Pfizer and 1.28% for AZ (per the Lancet study linked below).

The injections have numerous serious and fatal short term side effects and no long term safety data

If the injections don‚Äôt work on ‚Äúthe variants‚Äù (given people are still getting sick and dying and indeed in increasing numbers) , why continue to inject people with these same experimental injections that has shown themselves not to work?
