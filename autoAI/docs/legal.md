# Legal and medical Claims to be investigated


In Dec 2020, they knew these vaccines carry high risk of antibody dependent enhancement and didn't disclose it to clinical trial participants.

They didn't let the world know about it either! Now billions have been jabbed.

Aims of the study: Patient comprehension is a critical part of meeting medical ethics standards of informed consent in study designs. The aim of the study was to determine if sufficient literature exists to require clinicians to disclose the specific risk that COVID-19 vaccines could worsen disease upon exposure to challenge or circulating virus.

Results of the study: COVID-19 vaccines designed to elicit neutralising antibodies may sensitise vaccine recipients to more severe disease than if they were not vaccinated. Vaccines for SARS, MERS and RSV have never been approved, and the data generated in the development and testing of these vaccines suggest a serious mechanistic concern: that vaccines designed empirically using the traditional approach (consisting of the unmodified or minimally modified coronavirus viral spike to elicit neutralising antibodies), be they composed of protein, viral vector, DNA or RNA and irrespective of delivery method, may worsen COVID-19 disease via antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE). This risk is sufficiently obscured in clinical trial protocols and consent forms for ongoing COVID-19 vaccine trials that adequate patient comprehension of this risk is unlikely to occur, obviating truly informed consent by subjects in these trials.

What is mandatory?

What is MANDATORY? definition of MANDATORY (Black's Law Dictionary)
Definition of MANDATORY: 305, 47 N. E. 623; Atlanta v. Wright, 119 Ga. 207, 45 S. E. 004; State v. Lewis, 76 Mo. 370; Ex parte Crane, 5 Pet. 190, 8 L. Ed. 92; Marbury v. Madison,
-----------
Mandatory
"The action of mandamus [Latin for mandatory, "We command"] is one, brought in a court of competent jurisdiction, to obtain an older of such court commanding an inferior tribunal, board, corporation, or person to do or not to do an act the performance or omission of which the law enjoins as a duty resulting from an office, trust, or station. Where discretion is left to the inferior tribunal or person, the mandamus can only compel it to act, but cannot control such discretion."

Did you read that correctly? By legalese definition, YOU are INFERIOR to the arbitrary "laws" of the state. I thought the government and it's agencies worked for us? I thought they're supposed to protect our sovereignty?

A mandate is a LEGAL act to compel, NOT LAWFUL and "CANNOT control such discretion"...
Discretion: "Individual choice or judgement"

Translation... 
The state and their agencies can try to compel you to do something, but unless you give them consent, they CANNOT take further action, by their own definition.

Just because someone in "authority" tries to command you, you have a choice. A mandate isn't a law and doesn't require your participation. Wearing a mask or getting injected is a choice... 

IT IS NOT LAW OR LAWFUL

Legal and lawful are NOT the same...

You are complying with arbitrary legal acts that have no power or lawful standing
Any police officer handing out fines, demanding to see your exemption, escorting you off the premises, holding you under duress or ANY other compelling act/command are all UNLAWFUL acts/commands and have NO real power

 • You do NOT need to show exemption 
 • You do NOT need to pay unlawful fines
 • You do NOT need to cooperate 

Policing is supposed to be done via consent, so they can't do a damn thing without it... They only get away with what they do because you're ill informed and don't know how to deal with them...
It is YOUR duty as a sovereign citizen to not comply with unlawful acts of an unlawful government and unlawful police. It's YOUR duty to stop complying with tyrants that have ZERO clue about the "laws" they are enforcing.
 • Language matters
 • Consent matters
 • Constitutional and Common Laws matter
 • Natural Law is the source of your rights and common law is the enactment and protection of your natural rights
 • Rights matter
 • Freedom matters
 • Cherish it and fight for it...
 • When are you going to start being brave and stop complying with tyranny...?
