Good Afternoon Everyone

I hope you are all well. Many thanks for your response, Dr Berkowitz. 
That information is very useful.

1. Could you tell me what tests you are using, and also if and when they were patented? 

2. Has any independent testing of the tests been done? Where could I find this information?

3. Are they the same tests that the WHO has recommended be replaced at the end of 2021? ( see https://www.cdc.gov/csels/dls/locs/2021/07-21-2021-lab-alert-Changes_CDC_RT-PCR_SARS-CoV-2_Testing_1.html)

4. Have you used the same testing regimen and protocols since the beginning of the lockdown? 

5. Has any antibody testing been done in the general population?   

I did visit the link you sent. It seems to be more about vaccinations. 
You can see how many vaccinations, vaccinations plotted against cases per day. You can even register for the vaccine!

I also went to the SAHPRA site, and the SAMRC site, who are curiously all funded by the same entities.

I even downloaded the pdf.

This brings me back to the second part of my email, specifically questions that have been raised about the vaccine rollout but before I go there  I'd like to add one more.

6. I question the mask mandates, and the lack of science supporting them, particularly when the only people that are forced to obey them are the young and the vulnerable.  There is no discussion about unintended consequences, although there is plenty of scientific literature that explores this in detail. Please could somebody provide credible scientific evidence that masks work? 


7. PLease could anybody provide links to the studies that prove the safety, efficacy, and quality of the covid injection, especially in the light of the fact that SAHPRA has "drastically reduced our usual time frames for the registration of COVID-19 vaccines".

I have searched all the links that you have provided but cannot find any real information. 

8. People are being encouraged to register for a vaccine without consulting a physician first. This is unusual, as there are different risk groups and not everybody responds in the same way to treatment, so often more than one solution is required. To phrase this idiomatically, one man's meat is another man's poison.
Does the R80 Million from the Bill Gates have anything to do with driving the response?

I also cannot find a doctor to discuss the pros and cons of the vaccine, or the science behind some of the outlandish claims in the media. Many seem strangely terrified to discuss this. Do you have any idea why this could be?

Have a look at the NICD website . screenshot below refers.
 
I have physical evidence in the real world that runs counter to what the above paragraph claims. 

ie . perfectly healthy -> vaccine ->-fall ill -> go to doctor -> test positive for covid -> ????(can still transmit covid!)
Should I  report this as fake news?  The biologically impossible has been made possible!

What instructions have been given to medical professionals regarding testing of the recently vaccinated?
9. I also have questions about the mask mandates, and the lack of science supporting them, particularly when the only people that are forced to obey are the young and the vulnerable. There is no discussion about unintended consequences. Why is that?

10. The DA, or the city of cape town,  is also spending a lot of money to  increase social  division. see Free museum visits for the vaccinated, social media campaigns etc, etc, etc. Who is driving this agenda and what purpose does it serve?

11. Given that we now know that the vaccinated can spread the disease , as well as the unvaccinated, how would you recommend I interpret the call from the Democratic Alliance to report reckless or purposeful transmission of the coronavirus? Should I call this line whenever I see a public official breaking the mask mandate? Is this open to abuse and how do you check? Why does nobody answer the water line phone?
Many civilians have had quite brutal experiences with the law for much less. How do you feel about this?

12. Finally, please could someone provide me with the current rules of the lockdown as there is still enormous confusion as to what they are and whether they are even legal. Government should not be breaking their own laws. 

Is there an ethics committee we can add to this chain?
